Firefox Nightly Installer for Ubuntu 13.10 (12.04+)
==================================================

This is a script to safely install the latest Firefox Nightly Version in Ubuntu 13.10 (actually it works with any version higher than 12.04). 

The small program downloads the nightly build, create an specific session (called nightly-session) and make the launchers in order to easily access to the program.
